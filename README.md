# Trackmania Cup of the Day Leaderboard

**DISCLAIMER! This project is not related to Ubisoft Nadeo! It's a fan made project to generate and display a leaderboard for the Trackmania Cup of the Day.**

Get the game here: [Ubisoft Trackmania](https://www.ubisoft.com/de-de/game/trackmania/trackmania)

This project is based on the work of [pointerzio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSVwwjM2OoIEWwoiKy1CqMY9oKJ2EXqWvch_gPIrOzL8WtsSoYZ-KjsiZpR3Ygt3U08VW9fxFpRyv6R/pubhtml#)! Unfortunately he stopped working on this project.

## Information

At the start of the project there was only one edition of the Cup of the Days. Since then, two more editions have been added at 03:00 CET and 11:00 CET, which are now included in this project. Completely new leaderboards have also been created. There are now leaderboards for the best qualifiers for the Cup of the Day, the best time attack hunters and the mappers with the most tracks of the day. See below for details.

### Cup Leaderboard

The Cup Leaderboard can be divided into a `global` Leaderboard and a Leaderboard for each `month`. These leaderboards are further divided into the Main Cup Leaderboard (19:00 CET), the Night Rerun Leaderboard (03:00 CET) and the Morning Rerun Leaderboard (11:00 CET).

The top 10 divisions will be considered for the Main Cup (640 players).
For the two reruns, only the first two divisions will be counted (128 players).

In the Main Cup the winner will earn 1000 points while the 640th will get one point.
As there are fewer players in the reruns, the winner only gets 200 points and the 128th place finisher gets one point.

The function for the positions in between is shown in the diagram below.

#### Main Cup

$$\text{points(position)} = 1 + (\text{1000} - 1) \times \left(1 - \frac{\log_{10}(position)}{\log_{10}(\text{640})}\right) $$

#### Rerun Cup

$$\text{points(position)} = 1 + (\text{200} - 1) \times \left(1 - \frac{\log_{10}(position)}{\log_{10}(\text{128})}\right) $$

### Challenge Leaderboard

As qualifying for the Cup of the Day (Challenge) and the Cup itself are closely linked, the leaderboards are structured in the same way. See [Cup Leaderboard](#cup-leaderboard).

The function for the positions in between is shown in the diagram below.

#### Main Challenge

$$\text{points(position)} = 1 + (\text{1000} - 1) \times \left(1 - \frac{\log_{10}(position)}{\log_{10}(\text{640})}\right) $$

#### Rerun Challenge

$$\text{points(position)} = 1 + (\text{200} - 1) \times \left(1 - \frac{\log_{10}(position)}{\log_{10}(\text{128})}\right) $$

### Time Attack Leaderboard

There are two types of leaderboards in the game. A Seasonal Leaderboard (such as Campaigns), which does not change after the end of a season, and a Global Leaderboard, which stores all-time best times. There is also a seasonal leaderboard for the Track of the Days, which is used to calculate the Time Attack Leaderboard. The first 256 players of the ingame Seasonal Leaderboard will be considered in the Time Attack Leaderboard.

$$\text{points(position)} = 1 + (\text{1000} - 1) \times \left(1 - \frac{\log_{10}(position)}{\log_{10}(\text{256})}\right) $$

![Point Distribution Cups](images/points_distribution_comparison_Time%20Attack.jpg)

There are plans to implement another leaderboard for all-time best times. However, this would require a large number of queries to be sent to Nadeo's Trackmania API to update the results. It has therefore been decided not to implement such a leaderboard for the time being. However, if there is a high demand, this decision can be reversed.

### Mapper Leaderboard

The mappers deserve some recognition too! There is now a leaderboard for the mappers with the most Track of the Days. One point is awarded per track.

## Getting Started

All game APIs are to be used responsibly. Nadeo/Ubisoft can and will ban your accounts/IPs if they detect any disruptive (sending too many requests too fast) or any other malicious behavior.

1. Run `npm setup`
2. Extract Zone Flags

   1. Download the Game from Ubisoft Connect.
   2. Copy the `Maniaplanet_Flags.zip` from the Trackmania Files. By default the path should look like this: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Trackmania\Packs\Maniaplanet_Flags.zip`
   3. Run `ptyhon ./scripty/extract_flags.py`

3. Create a [dedicated server account](https://www.trackmania.com/?redirect=https://www.trackmania.com/player/dedicated-servers).
4. Create a [Trackmania OAuth App](https://webservices.openplanet.dev/oauth/auth).
5. Create an `.env` file.

### Docker

The project is also available as [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sowiemarkus/cotd-leaderboard) verf√ºgbar.

`docker pull sowiemarkus/cotd-leaderboard:latest`

To execute the image, the `.env` file, an SQLite database corresponding to `DATABASE_URL` and an `assets` folder with the images of the flags must be transferred as a volume.

Example with Docker Compose:

```yml
cotd-leaderboard:
  container_name: cotd-leaderboard-backend
  image: sowiemarkus/cotd-leaderboard:latest
  volumes:
    - ./cotd.db:/usr/src/app/cotd.db
    - ./assets:/usr/src/app/dist/assets
  env_file: .env
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
```
